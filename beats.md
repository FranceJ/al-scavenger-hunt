# Clue 2

### Ground Team
After deciphering the audio files, you’ll be looking for these objects near your present location. The first object overlooks the second, and both should point you in the direction that you should head. 

### Together
As you’re passing by the second object, see if your two teams can work together to find out which city this object originated from. Once you find this answer, please head to www.alertlabs.com/{insert-your-answer} to find your next clue! 

### Remote Team
If you find yourself with some spare time on your hands, the attached sudoku can keep you busy. It will be used to determine the location of a future clue.
