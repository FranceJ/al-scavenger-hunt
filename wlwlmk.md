# Clue 6

You can rest your legs! You’re done the scavenger hunt. To secure your “finishing” timestamp, please send us an email with a few photos of your team. Specifically,


### Ground Team
We’d like to see your reflection in a window, as you give us your best superhero poses! We’ll subtract a minute from your final time for every stranger you convince to (safely and distantly) join your photo up to a maximum of three strangers.

### Remote Team
Bend back (or cut off) Barbie’s head, because that ain’t her outfit - it’s yours! Take a photo with your head in place of hers.

Send those photos off!!!

### All
Thank you for your participation in the Alert Labs 2020 Scavenger Hunt! We hope you enjoyed your journey with us and learned something new along the way. 

The results of the scavenger hunt will be revealed during happy hour on Friday, after everyone has completed theirs. The LEGO bricks will be mailed to the winners the following week.
